# Star Wars Idle Game

## Purpose

The Star Wars Idle Game was created as a personal project to learn React. I chose to create an idle game because I thought it would involve a lot of components working together, and therefore give me hands-on experience with things like scope and component life-cycles.

## The Goal

There is no "real" goal for the game. When I feel I've made an adequate and good-looking game - and when I feel I've learned all I can from it - I'll call it done. That being said, there are some things I hope to accomplish with it.

### Some Things I Hope To Accomplish With It

- Some kind of storyline to keep things interesting.
- Parallel storylines/gameplay for Rebels/Empire
- Actually balanced gameplay (right now it's stupid hard to get more than 15 of anything and still the game can be completed in 10 minutes)
- A pretty UI would be nice
